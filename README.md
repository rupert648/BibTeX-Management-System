# CS4099 Project - BibTeX Management System
Under development. Being built using [Neon Bindings](https://neon-bindings.com): a library for writing safe and fast native Node.js modules in Rust, and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

### The Project
To develop a lightweight, fast desktop application for collating and merging `.bib` files on a volume. The application (will) searches a directory and subdirectories for any `.bib` files, then merges them, using techniques to find duplicate or near-duplicate citations. It then interacts with the user to choose the best method to proceed.
